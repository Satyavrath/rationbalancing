This project focuses on developing a web application for calculating balanced ration for cattle. This web-based application will help the end user to keep track of total amount of ingredients feed to the cattle per day along with the nutritionâ€™s consumed. With this application the user can avoid the cumbersome calculations and get the required output with simple steps.
